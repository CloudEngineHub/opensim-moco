/// The top-level class for solving a custom optimal control problem.
///
/// This class consists of a MucoProblem, which describes the optimal control
/// problem, and a MucoSolver, which describes the numerical method for
/// solving the problem.
///
/// Workflow
/// --------
/// When building a MucoTool programmatically (e.g., in C++), the workflow is as
/// follows:
///
/// 1. Build the MucoProblem (set the model, constraints, etc.).
/// 2. Call MucoTool::initSolver(), which returns a reference to the MucoSolver.
///    After this, you cannot edit the MucoProblem.
/// 3. Edit the settings of the MucoSolver (returned by initSolver()).
/// 4. Call MucoTool::solve(). This returns the MucoSolution.
/// 5. (Optional) Postprocess the solution, perhaps using MucoTool::visualize().
///
/// After calling solve(), you can edit the MucoProblem and/or the MucoSolver.
/// You can then call solve() again, if you wish.
///
/// Saving the tool setup to a file
/// -------------------------------
/// You can save the MucoTool to a file by calling MucoTool::print(), and you
/// can load the setup using MucoTool(const std::string& omucoFile).
/// MucoTool setup files have a `.omuco` extension.
///
/// Solver
/// ------
/// The default and only built-in solver uses the **tropter** direct
/// collocation library. We would like to support users plugging in their own
/// solvers, but there is no timeline for this. If you require additional
/// features or enhancements to the solver, please consider contributing to
/// **tropter**.

// TODO rename to MucoFramework.
