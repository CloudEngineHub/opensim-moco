Moco is a module of OpenSim for solving optimal control problems for
musculoskeletal systems defined as OpenSim models.
The package has Python, MATLAB, and XML (command-line) interfaces; the core
library is written in C++. Here are some problems you can solve with Moco:

1. Solve for the muscle activity that tracks a known motion.
2. Solve for a new motion that optimizes some cost (e.g., effort).
3. Solve for mass properties that minimize residual (unrealistic) forces.

The optimal control problems are solved using the direct collocation method.
Direct collocation itself is beyond the scope of this documentation; see
the following excellent material:

    how to do your own direct collocation. SIAM Review, 59(4), 849-904.

@defgroup mocogoal Available goals

These are the available goals you can use in your cost functional or as endpoint
constraints. If none of these satisfy your needs, you can define your own using
a plugin.

@page faq Frequently Asked Questions

@section How do I define a custom goal or cost term?

If Moco does not contain a cost term you need, you can create your own in C++ by
deriving from the MocoGoal class. If you do not want to use C++, you can draft
your goal in Matlab, send us your Matlab code, and we will consider implementing
it in C++ for you. See @ref customgoal for more information.

@section interrupt How do I interrupt an optimization in MATLAB?

Sometimes, you may want to interrupt an optimization before it is complete. In
MATLAB, we commonly use Ctrl-C to interrupt code, but this does not work during
a Moco optimization.

Use this alternative: During an optimization, Moco tries to write a text file to
your current directory named "delete_this...". Delete this file to interrupt the
optimization.
