- 2019-07-09: Cost terms can now depend on initial states/controls, not just
              final states/controls. Endpoint and integral costs are combined: a
              single cost can depend on both an integral and initial/final
              states/controls. This change is necessary to support costs like
              metabolic cost of transport, which depends on both the integral of
              metabolic rate and the difference between final and initial states
              (for distance traveled).
